# pi-config

[![video](assets/thumbnail.png)](https://www.youtube.com/@EeroAlvar)

My personal [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) configuration.

The setup from [My Pi Setup After 6 Months](https://www.youtube.com/@EeroAlvar) (and its predecessor, [Pi Coding Agent Setup After 2 Months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWWrLlM3gwQ)).

This is **not** meant to be installed as one big package. Browse the repo and copy the pieces you want into your own Pi config.

> **Nix note:** in this repo, the manual copy steps below are **not** used.
> Everything is deployed declaratively by [home/ai/pi.nix](../home/ai/pi.nix)
> into `~/.pi/agent/{extensions,skills}` (npm deps vendored, pdf-reader venv
> and Chromium provided by nixpkgs). Edit files here, run `just home-switch`,
> then `/reload` in Pi.

Some extensions are big enough to live in their own repositories:

- **[pi-interactive-subagents](https://github.com/amosblomqvist/pi-interactive-subagents)** — async, interactive subagents in multiplexer panes
- **[pi-observational-memory](https://github.com/amosblomqvist/pi-observational-memory)** — tiered session memory with deterministic compaction
- **[pi-dictate](https://github.com/amosblomqvist/pi-dictate)** — real-time voice dictation inside pi
- **[learn](https://github.com/amosblomqvist/learn)** — my AI learning system, built on top of this config

This repo contains everything else.

## Copy an extension

Single-file extension:

```bash
cp extensions/ask-user-question.ts ~/.pi/agent/extensions/
```

Directory extension:

```bash
cp -r extensions/browser ~/.pi/agent/extensions/
```

If the copied extension has a `package.json`, install its deps:

```bash
cd ~/.pi/agent/extensions/browser
npm install
```

Then restart pi or run `/reload`.

## Copy a skill

```bash
cp -r skills/pdf-reader ~/.pi/agent/skills/
```

Then restart pi or run `/reload`.

## Do not clone over your config

Avoid cloning this repo directly into `~/.pi/agent` unless it is a fresh setup. If you already use pi, copy individual files/folders instead so you don't replace your own config.

## Contents

### Extensions

- `ask-user-question.ts` — the agent asks you a question through a UI popup; popups from different extensions serialize via a shared UI lock
- `bash-guard/` — hooks that catch dangerous bash commands before they run, with an on/off toggle
- `browser/` — Playwright-driven headless Chromium the agent can drive (navigate, eval JS, inspect network/console, click, screenshot); off by default, enable with `/browser on`
- `custom-header.ts` — the big capital Π header
- `interactive-subagents/` — stub, see [pi-interactive-subagents](https://github.com/amosblomqvist/pi-interactive-subagents)
- `observational-memory/` — stub, see [pi-observational-memory](https://github.com/amosblomqvist/pi-observational-memory)
- `prompt-snippets/` — small, reusable behavior rules toggled onto a message before sending; reset after send
- `web-fetch/` — fetch a URL and get clean markdown
- `web-search/` — web search

### Skills

- `analyze-sessions/` — Python scripts to query past pi sessions: cost rollups, prompt-pattern mining, session rendering
- `pdf-reader/` — read PDFs (lecture notes, papers) into the context
- `web-debug/` — a playbook for debugging frontend issues with the browser extension's tools
- `youtube-transcript/` — fetch a YouTube video's title and transcript as JSON

### Deprecated

`deprecated/` holds the extensions and skills from the two-month setup that are no longer in active use. They still work; they just didn't earn their place. Kept for reference.

## Dependencies

Extension-local npm deps are kept with the extension. Run `npm install` only in copied extensions that include a `package.json`:

- `bash-guard/`
- `browser/` (also run `npx playwright install chromium` once)
- `web-fetch/`

Optional system tools:

```bash
brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg
```

Used by `youtube-transcript/`. Python 3 is needed for `youtube-transcript/` and `analyze-sessions/` (stdlib only).

PDF reader setup after copying `skills/pdf-reader/`:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.pi/agent/skills/pdf-reader/.venv
~/.pi/agent/skills/pdf-reader/.venv/bin/pip install -r ~/.pi/agent/skills/pdf-reader/requirements.txt
```
